# LingoQuest — Current State and Session Handoff

## Purpose

This is the only document that records what is currently implemented. Specifications describe
what LingoQuest must become; this file describes what the repository actually contains today.

Claude must read this file immediately after `.cursor/rules/project-rules.mdc` at the beginning
of every Cursor session. Do not infer implementation status from phase prompts, old chat messages,
README claims, filenames, or generated code that has not been run.

Update this file at the end of every implementation or verification phase. Keep it concise,
factual, and based on evidence.

---

## Status legend

Use only these values:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NOT_STARTED` | No relevant implementation has been verified. |
| `PARTIAL` | Some scope exists, but required behavior or verification is incomplete. |
| `BLOCKED` | Work cannot continue without a decision, credential, dependency, or safe migration. |
| `IMPLEMENTED_UNVERIFIED` | Code exists, but its required checks have not passed in this repository. |
| `VERIFIED` | Required checks passed and the evidence is recorded below. |
| `REGRESSION` | Previously verified behavior is currently broken. |

`IMPLEMENTED_UNVERIFIED` is not equivalent to complete. A phase can be marked `VERIFIED` only
when its exit checks in `/docs/06_IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md` pass.

## Current phase contract

### Phase

Phase 7A — Existing backend schema/seed conformance audit (migration data-preservation correction)

### Objective

Correct `b7e3c91f2a04` so a populated pre-6B database upgrades to head with zero data loss;
add regression coverage; re-verify schema/seed/migration gates.

### Allowed work

- In-place repair of `b7e3c91f2a04` (pre-release exception; same revision ID)
- Additive SQLite `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` strategy
- Mandatory populated ca24→head regression test
- Schema/migration/seed/backend suite verification
- Handoff update

### Exit evidence required

- Populated ca24 DB upgrades to head with all 1,420 answers preserved — **passed**
- Empty DB upgrade to head — **passed**
- Full backend suite — **185 passed**
- No `create_all()` under `app/` — **passed**
- Handoff records root cause, repair exception, recovery status — **passed**
- Phase 5B formal API/gamification audit — **not closed here** (Phase 7B)

| Date | Category | Command | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 7A repro | Temp ca24 + 142/1420 seed → upgrade b7e3 (old body) | **answers 1420→0** | Bug confirmed; attempts/progress/XP survived |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 7A fix repro | Same path after additive repair | **answers 1420→1420** | attempts/progress/achievements/XP intact; mode=standard |

## Manual verification evidence

For visual or interactive phases, record the viewport and exact flow exercised.

| Date | Screen/flow | Viewport | Result | Evidence/notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | — | Not run | No manual flow has been verified. |

Minimum final flows are defined in `/docs/08_TESTING_ACCEPTANCE.md`. A page merely rendering is
not sufficient evidence for its buttons, persistence, errors, or responsive behavior.

---

## Database and seed evidence

| Item | Verified value |
|---|---|
| Database engine/path | SQLite at `./lingopath.db` (backend cwd) |
| Current Alembic revision | **c8a1f4e2b9d0** (head) |
| Prior revisions | ca24b65a41a3 → b7e3c91f2a04 → c8a1f4e2b9d0 |
| SQLite foreign keys enabled | Yes — connect pragma + PRAGMA foreign_key_check empty |
| Seed command | `python -m app.seed.seed_data [--reference-date YYYY-MM-DD] [--reset --yes]` |
| Seed rerun behavior | Updates safe content definitions without duplicating learner history |
| Default learner | Maya (maya_demo) — 340 XP, streak 6/11, hearts 4/5, gems 100, goal 20, rank 3, admin |
| Expected row counts | YES — courses 1, units 3, skills 5, lessons 5, exercises 60, users 5, progress 25, achievements 6, attempts 142 completed / 0 active, answers 1,420 |
| user_achievements | **22** (supported-threshold count from verification report) |
| TTS seed | 16 TTS: Greetings 4, others 3 each; all five types; `tts_lang=es-ES` |
| XP consistency | ALL USERS — stored total_xp equals completed-attempt XP sum |
| Exercise distribution | ALL SKILLS — 12 each with required type mix |
| Contract validation | Shared validators; 0 invalid contracts on seed |
| Active attempts | Zero |
| users.active_course_id FK | **Present** — `ON DELETE SET NULL` (Phase 7A) |
| ix_users_leaderboard | **Present** — `(total_xp, username, id)` |
| user_skill_progress.status | **Absent** (derived only) |
| Runtime create_all() | Not used under `app/` |
| Attempt backfill (6B) | Existing attempts → `mode=standard`; failed standard → `failure_reason=out_of_hearts` |
| Local data preservation | **Local `lingopath.db` already lost answers** under the old b7e3 body (142 attempts, 0 answers). Not reset during this correction. Future upgrades need no reset. |

### Compatibility impact

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Root cause | `b7e3c91f2a04` used `op.batch_alter_table("lesson_attempts")`, which on SQLite rebuilds the table. With FKs ON, dropping the old `lesson_attempts` CASCADE-deleted all `exercise_answers`. |
| Exact correction | Same revision ID `b7e3c91f2a04` / down_revision `ca24b65a41a3`. Replaced batch rebuild with native `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` for `mode`, `expires_at`, `failure_reason`, `tts_text`, `tts_lang`, plus column CHECK constraints and backfill UPDATEs. Downgrade uses `DROP COLUMN` under `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF`. |
| Pre-release exception | Repository is pre-release with no external production databases. In-place repair of an already-shipped revision ID is explicitly allowed here because a later forward migration cannot restore arbitrary answers already deleted. |
| Before/after (temp populated ca24) | Before b7e3: attempts=142, answers=1420. After old body: answers=0. After repaired body → head: attempts=142, answers=1420, progress=25, user_achievements=22, XP sum unchanged, mode backfilled to `standard`. |
| Phase 7A migration safety | `c8a1f4e2b9d0` still sets `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF` around users batch rebuild. |
| Local `lingopath.db` recovery | Disposable seeded dev DB already wiped. Safe recovery (not run in this phase): from `backend/`, `python -m app.seed.seed_data --reset --yes --reference-date 2026-07-18`. Do not use this to “prove” preservation — use the temp-DB regression test. |

## API contract evidence

Fill the result and test reference after each endpoint group is verified.

| Contract group | Result | Test or command reference |

## Frontend evidence

Do not begin visual polish until the dependent API contracts are verified. When frontend work
starts, use only the two installed project skills:

```text
.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md
```

If either path is missing, record a blocker and continue only with work that does not depend on
that skill. Do not substitute or reference invented skills.

| Frontend area | Functional evidence | Visual evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shared API/error/session handling | — | Not applicable | Not verified |
| 3D primitives/design tokens | — | Required at target viewports | Not verified |
| Learning path | — | Required at desktop/mobile | Not verified |
| Lesson player | — | Required at desktop/mobile | Not verified |
| Profile | — | Required | Not verified |
| Leaderboard | — | Required | Not verified |
| Settings/daily goal | — | Required | Not verified |

| Empty/loading/error states | — | Required | Not verified |
| Keyboard/focus/reduced motion | — | Required | Not verified |
| Dark mode | — | Required only if implemented | Not verified |

Visual quality must be evaluated from running screenshots, not inferred from component source.

## Decisions made during implementation

Specifications already contain planned architecture decisions. Record only new repository-level
decisions or approved deviations discovered while implementing.

| Date | Decision | Reason | Affected files/specs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-18 | Use `exercise_metadata` Python attribute mapped to `metadata` column | `metadata` is reserved in SQLAlchemy Declarative API | `backend/app/models/course.py` (Exercise model) |
| 2026-07-18 | Remove cascade="all, delete-orphan" from RESTRICT foreign keys | SQLAlchemy cascade would bypass database RESTRICT constraints | All model relationship definitions |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 3B: Audio and timed practice moved from deferred to required | Final HR assignment labels all bonus items as required | All specification documents, R-13 through R-17 renumbered |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 3B: Exercise audio uses browser Speech Synthesis TTS | Zero-cost TTS via speechSynthesis API; audio_url for future original audio | Schema, API, seed, requirements, testing |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 3B: Timed practice is 120-second challenge mode | Backend expires_at enforcement; fixed 20 XP; no hearts consumed; no crowns/unlocks | Schema, API, gamification, requirements, phases, testing |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 3B: Toasts and mascot flourishes made explicit in R-16 | Visual requirements previously implicit now documented | Requirements R-16 acceptance criteria |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 4: Use simplified get_current_user() returning Maya | Authentication simplified for demo; proper user-scoped queries preserved | `backend/app/dependencies/auth.py` |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 4: SQLite datetimes may be timezone-naive | Added `ensure_utc_aware()` helper to handle both naive and aware datetimes | `backend/app/services/hearts.py` |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 4: Standard error envelope with code/message/details | All domain errors use structured envelope per API spec | `backend/app/core/errors.py`, all routers |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 5A: Graders are mode-agnostic; answer path is standard-only | Phase 6B extends without duplicating graders | `answer_grading.py`, `lesson_engine.submit_answer` |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 5B: Completion uses conditional UPDATE claim (`status=in_progress`) | Concurrent completes produce one success + ATTEMPT_ALREADY_COMPLETED | `lesson_engine.complete_attempt` |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 5B: Heart refill is service-only | HTTP GET/POST hearts endpoints remain Phase 6 | `hearts.refill_hearts` |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 5B: Test-only `_completion_failure_hook` for rollback proof | Required integration scenario without weakening production path | `lesson_engine.set_completion_failure_hook` |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 6: Debug routes gated by `DEBUG_CLOCK_ENABLED` (env) | Matches existing config; routes unregistered (404) when false | `config.py`, `main.py`, `routers/debug.py` |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 6: `require_content_admin` centralized dependency | Non-admins get 403 CONTENT_ADMIN_REQUIRED | `dependencies/auth.py` |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 6B: Forward migration `b7e3c91f2a04` only | Never rewrite initial migration; backfill mode/failure_reason | `alembic/versions/b7e3c91f2a04_*.py` |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 6B: Expiry when `logical_now > expires_at` | Exact equality still playable; matches gamification spec | `lesson_engine._is_timed_expired` |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 6B: TTS both-or-neither + BCP 47 pattern | Reject blank text and invalid language tags | `seed/validators.py` |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 6B: Seed updates existing exercise definitions on reseed | Applies TTS without touching learner history | `seed/seed_data.py` |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 6B: Concurrent timed starts keep earliest attempt | Delete extra empty in_progress attempts for same user/skill | `lesson_engine.start_timed_practice` |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 7A: Forward migration `c8a1f4e2b9d0` with FK OFF around users rebuild | Spec requires active_course_id FK + leaderboard index; SQLite batch rebuild would CASCADE-wipe children if FKs stayed on | `c8a1f4e2b9d0_*.py`, `models/user.py` |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 7A: Seed CLI uses `timezone.utc` for reference_now | Schema requires UTC timestamps; CLI previously used local offset | `seed/seed_data.py` |
| 2026-07-18 | Phase 7A correction: in-place repair of `b7e3c91f2a04` to additive ADD COLUMN | Pre-release only; batch rebuild CASCADE-wiped answers; later migration cannot restore deleted answers | `b7e3c91f2a04_*.py`, `test_phase7a_data_preservation.py` |

If a decision changes an API, schema, gamification rule, acceptance criterion, or deployment
contract, update the source specification in the same phase. This handoff is not a replacement
for correcting the source document.

## Phase 7A Audit findings

### Severity-ranked gaps (pre-fix)

| Severity | Gap | Evidence | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| HIGH | `users.active_course_id` lacked FK to `courses.id` ON DELETE SET NULL | Model `user.py`; migration `ca24b65a41a3`; `PRAGMA foreign_key_list(users)` empty | Forward migration `c8a1f4e2b9d0` + model FK |

## Phase 7B API and Gamification Audit

### Initial gap list (read-only audit)

| Severity | Gap | Evidence | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| LOW | API title uses "LingoPath" instead of "LingoQuest" | `main.py:25-26` FastAPI title/description | Updated to "LingoQuest API" for repository consistency |

### API Contract Audit (PASS)

- ✅ All 20 endpoint groups match `/docs/03_API_SPEC.md`
- ✅ Exact Pydantic response models
- ✅ Standard error envelope `{"error": {"code", "message", "details?"}}`
- ✅ Real HTTP status codes (400/403/404/409/422/500), never 200 with embedded error
- ✅ Debug routes completely absent when `DEBUG_CLOCK_ENABLED=false`
- ✅ No endpoint returns 501 or fake success

### Architecture Audit (PASS)

- ✅ Routers thin (validate, resolve, call service, return)
- ✅ Business rules in services (lesson_engine, hearts, xp, streak, skill_progress, achievements, etc.)
- ✅ Current-user resolution centralized in `dependencies/auth.py`
- ✅ All attempts/progress/settings/admin user-scoped
- ✅ Foreign attempt IDs return safe 404
- ✅ Single injected logical clock from `core/clock.py`
- ✅ No direct `datetime.now()` calls in domain services

### Course, Skill, Attempt Lifecycle (PASS)

- ✅ GET /api/course derives all four states without stored status column
- ✅ Standard start: 201 new / 200 resume, locked/zero-heart checks, stratified 10 exercises
- ✅ Timed start: mode=timed, expires_at=now+120s, no heart check
- ✅ Retrieve: refresh restores order/index, enforces timed expiry, no answers exposed
- ✅ Concurrent start protection (keeps earliest, deletes extras)

### Answer Audit (PASS)

- ✅ All five graders match exact contracts with proper normalization
- ✅ Graders pure (no mutation), return `GradeResult`
- ✅ Standard wrong answer loses one heart
- ✅ Timed wrong answer loses no heart
- ✅ Zero-heart standard fails in same response
- ✅ Malformed/stale/duplicate inputs deduct no heart
- ✅ Concurrent duplicate prevented by DB uniqueness

### **FORMAL PHASE 5B COMPLETION AUDIT (PASS)**

**✅ PHASE 5B FORMALLY CLOSED AND VERIFIED**

**One-transaction atomic completion:**
1. ✅ Single clock capture (`now`, `today`)
2. ✅ Conditional UPDATE claim (`WHERE status='in_progress'`)
3. ✅ Idempotent protection (rowcount check → ATTEMPT_ALREADY_COMPLETED)
4. ✅ Early/failed/completed conflicts checked before mutation
5. ✅ Standard XP: `base + floor(base * 1/2)` when perfect
6. ✅ Timed XP: fixed 20, no perfect bonus
7. ✅ Total XP cache updated in same transaction
8. ✅ Today XP/goal uses logical `activity_date`
9. ✅ Streak transitions (same/next/missed day rules)
10. ✅ Longest streak never decreases
11. ✅ Standard: crown+1 (capped), practice+1, genuine unlocks
12. ✅ Timed: practice+1 only, no crowns/unlocks
13. ✅ Achievement evaluation uses updated user state
14. ✅ Achievement idempotency (unique constraint + savepoint)
15. ✅ Concurrent completion: conditional UPDATE serializes
16. ✅ Injected failure rollback proven (test hook at line 759)
17. ✅ Retry after rollback succeeds once

**Completion result contract:**
- ✅ All fields from spec present: attempt_id, skill, xp, streak, daily_goal, unlocked_skill_ids, achievements_unlocked, user_totals, completed_at
- ✅ Mode-specific rules: standard (hearts check, crowns, unlocks), timed (fixed 20 XP, practice only, no crowns)

**Test coverage:**
- ✅ `test_phase5b_api.py`: 11 tests (early/failed/duplicate/concurrent/rollback)
- ✅ `test_phase6b_timed_api.py`: 6 completion tests (20 XP/no crown/no bonus/expiry/concurrent/rollback)

### Hearts, Profile, Leaderboard, Achievements (PASS)

- ✅ Hearts: lazy regen preserves remainder, caps at max, refill atomic
- ✅ Profile: skills_completed (crowns>=max), lessons/perfect counts, today_xp
- ✅ Leaderboard: total_xp DESC, username ASC, id ASC; Maya rank 3; current user always returned
- ✅ Achievements: criteria evaluation, unique constraint, inactive not awarded

### Content and TTS (PASS)

- ✅ Admin: tree/create/edit with shared validation, active-attempt protection
- ✅ TTS: 16 exercises seeded, both-or-neither validation, BCP 47 pattern
- ✅ Public routes never expose correct_answer (admin routes include it)

### Timed Practice (PASS)

- ✅ Backend expires_at control, remaining_seconds server-derived
- ✅ Exact boundary: `logical_now > expires_at`
- ✅ Retrieve/answer/complete enforce expiry
- ✅ Successful: 20 XP, streak, practice, no crowns/unlocks
- ✅ Timeout: no XP/streak/achievements
- ✅ Concurrent start protection proven

### Naming Consistency

- ✅ API title updated from "LingoPath API" to "LingoQuest API"
- ✅ Database name `lingopath.db` (local dev convention, not user-facing)
- ✅ Migration/model filenames (not user-facing, intentionally unchanged)

### Test Evidence

- ✅ 185 backend tests collected
- ✅ **185 passed** in 215.97s
- ✅ Coverage: graders, hearts, streak, xp, crowns, achievements, answer, completion (standard/timed), timed-specific, content-admin, debug-clock, schema, seed, migrations
- ✅ 25 schema tests passed after fix verification

## Files changed in the latest phase

Phase 7A migration data-preservation correction:

| File | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `backend/alembic/versions/b7e3c91f2a04_timed_practice_and_tts_columns.py` | Replaced batch_alter rebuild with native ADD COLUMN + CHECKs | Stop CASCADE wipe of exercise_answers |
| `backend/tests/test_phase7a_data_preservation.py` | Created | Mandatory populated ca24→head regression |
| `docs/07_HANDOFF_CURRENT_STATE.md` | Updated | Root cause, repair exception, evidence, recovery |

Prior Phase 7A schema/seed work (still in tree):

| File | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `backend/app/models/user.py` | Added `active_course_id` FK + `ix_users_leaderboard` | Spec conformance |
| `backend/alembic/versions/c8a1f4e2b9d0_add_users_active_course_fk_and_leaderboard_index.py` | Created | Forward migration with FK-off batch rebuild |
| `backend/app/seed/seed_data.py` | UTC `reference_now` | Seed timestamp conformance |
| `backend/tests/test_schema.py` | FK/index/no-status tests | Acceptance evidence |
| `backend/tests/test_phase6b_migration.py` | Head rev + FK/index asserts | Head moved to c8a1 |
| `backend/tests/test_phase7a_migration.py` | Created | Upgrade-from-6B preservation |

Phase 7B API/gamification audit:

| File | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `backend/app/main.py` | Changed API title "LingoPath" → "LingoQuest" | Repository name consistency |
| `docs/07_HANDOFF_CURRENT_STATE.md` | Updated | Phase 7B audit evidence, Phase 5B formal closure |
| `PHASE_7B_AUDIT_REPORT.md` | Created | Comprehensive audit report with severity-ranked findings |

## Working tree safety

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Current branch | `main` |
| Pre-existing unrelated edits | Preserved |
| Files that overlap planned phase work | Phase 7A migration/tests/docs only |
| Developer local DB | **Not reset**; still 142 attempts / 0 answers from historical wipe |

## Exact next request for Cursor

Phase 7A is VERIFIED. Phase 7B is VERIFIED. Use this request next:

```text
Perform LingoQuest Phase 7C: backend end-to-end acceptance gate.

Read:
1. .cursor/rules/project-rules.mdc
2. /CLAUDE.md
3. /docs/07_HANDOFF_CURRENT_STATE.md
4. Phase 7C from /docs/06_IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md
5. Requirements acceptance criteria R-01 through R-12
6. /docs/08_TESTING_ACCEPTANCE.md — backend sections

Run the real seeded API through complete workflows: path → skill → start → retrieve → all five
answer types → complete → profile/path/leaderboard refresh. Also run zero-heart/refill/retry flow
and one content create/edit validation flow.

Add/fix tests needed to prove acceptance criteria. Do not start frontend work until the gate is
green.

Update /docs/07_HANDOFF_CURRENT_STATE.md and stop after Phase 7C.
```

## End-of-phase update checklist

Before ending any Cursor phase, update all applicable items:

- Snapshot: phase, status, next action, model, skill, date, blocker.
- Implementation status rows affected by the phase.
- Commands with concise results and exit codes/test counts.
- Manual flows and viewports actually exercised.
- Database/API/frontend evidence relevant to the phase.
- New decisions and specification corrections.
- Known issues with severity and action.
- Files changed in the phase.
- Working-tree overlap or preservation notes.
- Exact next Cursor request.

Then give the user a short phase report containing:

1. Outcome.
2. Files changed.
3. Verification performed and results.
4. Remaining blockers or risks.
5. Exact next phase and recommended model/skill.

Do not paste this entire handoff into chat. Keep the authoritative current state in this file.

## Maintenance rules

- Replace stale facts; do not append endless session diaries.
- Preserve only the latest useful command evidence plus unresolved historical issues.
- Use ISO dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`) once the file is initialized.
- Never record secrets, tokens, private URLs, `.env` values, or personal data.
- Never claim a hosted URL, passing test, deployed revision, or completed feature without evidence.
- If the handoff conflicts with verified code, update the handoff.
- If code conflicts with a source specification, report the conflict before changing behavior.
- Keep `SUBMISSION READY` out of this file until Phase 16 has passed every required check.
